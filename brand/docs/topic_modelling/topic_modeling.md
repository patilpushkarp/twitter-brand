# Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to automatically identify the topics or themes that are present in a collection of text documents. This is done by using machine learning algorithms to analyze the words and phrases in the documents and to group them into topics based on their co-occurrence and similarity. The output of a topic modeling algorithm is a set of topics, each of which is represented by a list of the words and phrases that are most strongly associated with that topic.

Topic modeling can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as document classification, document summarization, and information retrieval. It can help to automatically organize a large corpus of text documents into a set of coherent topics, which can make it easier to search and navigate the documents. It can also help to identify trends and patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent, and it can provide valuable insights into the content and structure of the documents.

In this section, the following topic modeling algorithms will be used:
1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation
2. BERTopic
