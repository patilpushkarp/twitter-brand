# Social Media Analytics

## Introduction

Social media analytics is the process of measuring, analyzing, and interpreting data from social media platforms in order to understand how a brand is performing on those platforms and to gain insights into the attitudes and behaviors of its audience. This can help brands identify trends and patterns in their social media activity, track the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns, and make data-driven decisions to improve their social media strategy. Some common metrics that are used in social media analytics include engagement rate, reach, clicks, likes, shares, and comments. Brands can use social media analytics tools to collect and analyze data from multiple social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, in order to gain a comprehensive view of their social media performance.

Brands can leverage social media in a number of ways to achieve their business goals. Some of the most common ways that brands use social media include:
1. Engaging with customers: Social media platforms provide an opportunity for brands to engage directly with their customers, respond to their questions and concerns, and provide support. This can help build customer trust and loyalty, and can also provide valuable feedback that the brand can use to improve its products or services.
2. Building brand awareness: Social media can be an effective way for brands to raise awareness of their products or services, and to reach new customers. By creating engaging and informative content, and by promoting that content on social media platforms, brands can increase their visibility and attract new followers.
3. Driving website traffic and sales: Social media can be an effective tool for driving traffic to a brand's website and for generating sales. By sharing links to products or services on social media, brands can encourage their followers to visit their website and make a purchase.
4. Improving customer service: Social media platforms can be used to improve customer service by providing a quick and convenient way for customers to get in touch with the brand. This can help reduce response times and improve the overall customer experience.
Overall, leveraging social media effectively can help brands build relationships with their customers, increase brand awareness, drive website traffic and sales, and improve customer service.

## About

### About the company - [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/about-us/)

Starbucks Corporation is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington. It is the world's largest coffeehouse chain. In addition to drinks and food, many stores carry Starbucks' official merchandise, such as mugs, tumblers, scoops, and coffee presses. There are also several select "Starbucks Evenings" locations that offer beer, wine, and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are sold at grocery stores in the United States and other countries.
Starbucks was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place Market. During the early 1980s, they sold the company to Howard Schultz who – after a business trip to Milan, Italy – decided to convert the coffee bean store into a coffee shop serving espresso-based drinks. As of November 2021, the company had 33,833 stores in 80 countries, 15,444 of which were located in the United States. Out of Starbucks' U.S.-based stores, over 8,900 are company-operated, while the remainder are licensed.
The rise of the second wave of coffee culture is generally attributed to Starbucks, which introduced a wider variety of coffee experiences. Starbucks serves hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal, or specific to the locality of the store.
