 &#39;I used to hate Starbucks but now I love it so much I want to invent new Frappuccino flavors&#39;,
 &#39;philz needs to replace the starbucks on story and white fr&#39;,
 &#39;@staceyabrams @BeeForGeorgia There were more people at our Starbucks grand opening&#39;,
 &#39;I went to the mall and bought few things for winter and then went to Starbucks and bought a cosy drinks for family&#39;,
 &#39;Everytime I order a white hot chocolate from @Starbucks, they always give me a mocha)): I know they use the same syrup but they always add espresso and ya girl doesn’t like coffee\U0001fae0&#39;,
 &#39;@MidnightSunBT @JoeSPalmer @JackPosobiec @elonmusk I’m actually offsetting my @Starbucks intake to make this happen. I enjoy the engagement.&#39;,
 &#39;Need a dragon fruit refresher from Starbucks right now \U0001f979😭&#39;,
 &#39;Don\&#39;t submit then quit. Apply for jobs like &quot;shift supervisor - Store# 11905, OLD CUTLER RD &amp;amp; SW 168TH ST&quot; at Starbucks, then look for people you might know at the company. You might be able to reach out to HR directly. Ready to apply? Check out the link in our bio.&#39;,
 &quot;so if you don&#39;t pay you get buried. How many twitter followers do struggle w/ finances, do not run to starbucks as he thinks, and we will become irrelevant and unworthy....bull shit https://t.co/7vULbMJapX&quot;,
 &#39;@TitusNation I have better things to do with my $8...like buying a Starbucks latte. lol&#39;,
 &#39;starbucks not bringing back the eggnog latte is my 13th reason&#39;,
 &#39;@laurenboebert The only ones that are crying about 8$ blue check are the ones who buy 10$ coffees at Starbucks&#39;,
 &#39;@WholeMarsBlog @elonmusk @AOC Buy them a cup of @Starbucks to share&#39;,
 &#39;@Lloyd_SpeakUpMH @_Emily_Hicks @Starbucks Don’t tell me you’ve never had a gingerbread latte…?!…&#39;,
 &quot;@nothinbutlag You could pay $8 for it... nah, you&#39;re better off buying a drink from Starbucks...&quot;,
 &#39;@GuntherEagleman Starbucks, McDonald’s, burgerking, are all hiring!&#39;,
 &#39;Why is @Starbucks never putting whipped cream on my drink anymore? 😭&#39;,
 &#39;Why’d I think @oompaville was at my Starbucks fixings the dishwasher?? YouTube not going well for ya buddy😂 https://t.co/mb4aO9L1ZC&#39;,
 &#39;I can start your day off with my family I mean, Starbucks is all like happy feeling.&#39;,
 &#39;@GerberKawasaki Starbucks is $5+ a drink. Entry fees to nightclubs are upwards of $50+ for a night. Blue check is $8 a month. Try harder. Living up to the falsehoods of the left aren’t you @GerberKawasaki&#39;,
 &#39;I would love to watch Grown man who are stans what would they do or how would they  act if there idol walked into a Starbucks and stood a few feet away&#39;,

 &#39;Going to Starbucks to get my fav drinks and going to Barnes and noble to get books is my way of self care&#39;,
 &#39;@Huwaiiii Why because it’s not Starbucks? 😂&#39;,
 &#39;Starbucks run and home to relax and watch my shows🥰&#39;,
 &quot;@MrsVeriTea @Starbucks Not really no, but you&#39;re both beautiful 🥰🥰&quot;,
 &#39;Seven weeks before Dec. 25, they’re already playing Christmas music, serving Christmas coffees and have a Christmas tree up at the Starbucks in Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin. 🎄 https://t.co/vUeIaoLsKx&#39;,
 &#39;@WholeMarsBlog @elonmusk @AOC Starbucks&#39;,
 &#39;First Starbucks Christmas drink of the season. https://t.co/4r78zu0mIG&#39;,
 &quot;why are people treating mcdonald&#39;s as if it&#39;s starbucks😭&quot;,
 &#39;@elonmusk  I currently do not have the blue check next to my name, but I will gladly pay the $8 monthly fee to support this program. All I have to do is cut out one of my monthly trips to Starbucks. Heck, I will even have money left over!&#39;,
 &#39;Maybe next time i go to the mall i should visit starbucks. Treat myself a bit&#39;,
 &#39;@Lloyd_SpeakUpMH @Starbucks You SO have… &amp;amp; I’m telling you - you’re SO going to regret it… \n(… good job this love affair returns every year!! 😘☕️🎃)&#39;,

 &#39;@Cheesecake7777 Our M says once the Starbucks app turned red on her phone, it was game on for Christmas tunes 😂&#39;,
 &#39;@mike_rippy @JoeSPalmer @JackPosobiec @elonmusk I agree. If people want to see Twitter succeed as a free speech platform then I think $8 is a small price to pay. How many people spend that on Starbucks everyday?&#39;,
 &#39;Have I gone to Starbucks 3 days in a row to try every holiday drink ? Yes, yes I have&#39;,
 &#39;@kimbokintz @Camelid @kylenabecker @elonmusk @pfizer @Oreo @GeneralMills @Audi Ma’am I promise you Starbucks was this way for longer than 2.5 years&#39;,
 &#39;Not this lady at Starbucks accidentally taking my drink, thinking it was hers. I hope she likes peppermint mocha.&#39;,
 &#39;@RonFilipkowski @fxmacro @somebadideas Just have less 2 Starbucks a month and get over it&#39;,
 &quot;I&#39;m tired of beats so I might change my environment \n\nMight cook up on twitch at Starbucks until the homie&#39;s free to record&quot;,
 &quot;@bunts1634 i think so too but i think that&#39;d be fun content to do a &#39;what do you normally get at starbucks?&#39; video&quot;,

 &#39;@dellcam Conservatives have boycotted Starbucks so many times they finally gave up trying.&#39;,

 &#39;No time to go to Starbucks but mungbean milk tea is always crackkkk https://t.co/EboiXGivyx&#39;,
 &quot;It&#39;s absurd that in Europe you have to pay to use half a euro to use a bathroom which is why I support the American system where the only way you can use a bathroom in a city is by paying $5 at a Starbucks&quot;,
 &quot;@catturd2 @elonmusk Yes, absolutely, it&#39;s the price of a beer at a bar or a coffee at Starbucks.&quot;,
 &#39;Definitely going to be a Starbucks type of night&#39;,
 &quot;14. Definitely tea will always be my number one, but I like coffee too. I&#39;m a sucker for those seasonal Starbucks coffees okay 😭\n\nHonestly anything with caffeine is good with me ☕\U0001f9cb🧉&quot;,

 &#39;@liberal_hack_ @Peacock037 @WowbaggerT @JoshuaPHilll So what if McDonald’s workers did what the Starbucks workers are doing and decided to unionize and demand higher wages.

 &#39;@PressSec The disdain you must have for the American people to spout these lies — to tell the public to not believe what they heard in plain English… it is revolting.\n\nYou belong slinging coffee at Starbucks, not in front of a podium insulting our intelligence.&#39;,
 &#39;@Starbucks @Anthony_Goins03 Unfortunately, an inferior alternative 🥺&#39;,
 &#39;Starbucks can fuck right off “we don’t do large or cream here, this isn’t Tim Hortons”. You can’t figure out what a large coffee 2 cream 2 sugars is? But I’m the idiot in this transaction?&#39;,

 &#39;@janschakowsky @Starbucks I know they closed one shop in the district that recently unionized. That’s one way to not cover people.&#39;,
 &#39;@leedevito I bet the same people bitching about $8 a month spends that much on one Starbucks coffee a day or something similar!&#39;,
 &#39;@thillerich12 @Starbucks @ChipotleTweets I could see them utilizing SBTs rather than NFTs to authenticate a loyalty program&#39;,
 &#39;@piyushmittal It’s also a false equivalence because people would be upset if Starbucks had been giving away $8 drinks for free since their opening day and now they were deciding to charge that would be an equivalence but it’s not what happened. #ElonMuskIsATroll and dumb&#39;,
 &#39;@StarbucksCanada @Starbucks curious why I ended up with an “extra water” drink?  Very watered down and had little flavour 👎🏼 https://t.co/42i15hBERy&#39;,

 &#39;FOR REAL. Even a Starbucks-style &quot;macchiato&quot; isn\&#39;t the same as an unstirred latte because they add the espresso after the milk instead of before, AND (ideally) the shot is ristretto so it has a different flavor\nDon\&#39;t even get me started on a latte vs a true macchiato https://t.co/UVv10ak2tO&#39;,

 &#39;That’s actually $1.46 per Canadian Citizen @PierrePoilievre.  How much did you spend on coffee today at Timmies or Starbucks?  Are you really dragging this shit out over this pittance?  That’s why you’ll never be PM.  You’re petty and stupid.  #PeePeeMustGo https://t.co/fJOKRGctHP&#39;,

 &quot;@AngieBeatDown @StarbucksUK If you&#39;re not blind they may have not known. And even if you are, they may not know about guide dogs. They work in Starbucks. Chill out mate&quot;,
 &#39;I love how expensive @Starbucks is, just for them to get my order wrong. https://t.co/GEabkbZogw&#39;,
 &#39;#Starbucks staff a dumb ass. Guide dog is a clue https://t.co/hDxoYfTIFJ&#39;,
 &quot;@AngieBeatDown @StarbucksUK 1. that dog is massively huggable &amp;amp; kissable (even if we can&#39;t because he&#39;s working)\n2. seeing that dog in starbucks would make most people&#39;s day even if we can only look at him .\n3. humans suck. dogs rule&quot;,
 &quot;@AngieBeatDown @StarbucksUK Eh I waited outside my local Starbucks for my son with my non guide hound and the staff invited us in. Not that I&#39;d ever drink their foul burned vomit tasting brew.&quot;,

 &#39;@laurenboebert Let’s be honest. They’re really mad because it’s too cheap and easy to be like them now. If it was a $2k annual fee they’d pay it in a heartbeat to be exclusive. \n\nBut they can’t say that. \n\nThese are people spending $2k plus on coffee to have a gold status at Starbucks.&#39;,

 &quot;I have to read labels carefully now and it&#39;s so wild how much sugar is in EVERYTHING. \n\nA grande peppermint mocha from Starbucks has 54g of sugar 🤯\n\nSince I&#39;m trying to combat inflammation due to celiac, need to be relatively low added sugar too&quot;,
 &#39;At One Point Starbucks Had Me In A Chokehold. I Was There Everyday&#39;,
 &#39;@Bryan_Keeley1 @disclosetv Yeah, he coulda spent that money on a mocha Frappuccino at Starbucks instead!\n\nJust shut up&#39;,
 &#39;@ThatCaliforniab @actinglife3 @_sn_n Most Mormons I’ve ever seen can’t even give up Starbucks, let alone do they desire some kind of fascistic takeover.&#39;,

 &#39;@mayalla17 This is literally the same &quot;argument&quot; people at the bottom of multilevel marketing schemes use, down to the Starbucks cost comparison. I\&#39;m impressed that his marketing skills peak at the level of former high school classmates trying to sell you fake weight-loss pills on Facebook.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m not even defending starbucks because who cares this is just the same &quot;it\&#39;s a banana, how much could it cost?&quot; energy as the guy who whined about how his taco bell cost 28 bucks because he was apparently ordering servings for like 3 people&#39;,
 &#39;idk how anyone gets more than a single shot in their starbucks drink yall are brave bc espresso makes me shit like it literally burns my insides&#39;,
 &#39;@gremloreart Crush on the girl who works in the flower shop. He has Colombian roots since that is where the plant comes from. The thing with Starbucks and refills is a really cool idea so I’ll put that in my notes&#39;,
 &#39;for the first time ever, ma starbucks wasnt ready when i got there. and it the one time i needed it cause now ima be late fa work&#39;,
 &#39;Hoping Starbucks calls me back soon tho because benefits are great and because I feel like I’ll be a great barista.&#39;,
 &#39;@nicolen923 @pjsforestkid i only know about starbucks in train stations and airports&#39;,

 &#39;I had a job interview last Thursday for my local movie theatre and a Starbucks.\nTheatre said they’d call me within 4-5 days while Starbucks would call me at the latest Monday.\nTheatre called me 4 hours after my interview with them. Didn’t think I nailed that interview that much.&#39;,
 &#39;@AngieBeatDown @StarbucksUK They need to take a few tips from my local Starbucks in South London. All dogs are welcome there. There’s a water bowl outside and the lovely staff often do doggy brews. There’s even a pinboard of all the favourite pooches ❤️ It’s not that difficult to be canine friendly.&#39;,
 &#39;@shaneblack_ @Starbucks @ChipotleTweets Starbucks is essentially turning their current rewards program on their app into a program that is NFT based.

 &quot;@MadScientistFF My brothers &amp;amp; sisters. My dad used to get tickets for a movie early like noon and we&#39;d spend like 6-8 hours at the theater. We&#39;d be jacked up on refillable Soda and popcorn after 3 or 4 movies, go for dinner and then he&#39;d take us to a chapters/starbucks combo and let us run wild.&quot;,

 &#39;So frequent at my local Starbucks, I don’t even have to ask for oat milk anymore. They just know 😭💗&#39;,
 &#39;@Starbucks Why is there no option on the app to place an order of the holiday drinks without espresso at all and only decaf? 💁🏻\u200d♀️💁🏻\u200d♀️&#39;,

 &quot;@FireLt1776 @Trump4Prison24 @unscriptedmike 1) Pretty sure it&#39;s the right wing/MAGAs who have the upper hand on cancel culture: Nike, Starbucks, Keurig, NFL, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Budweiser, Gillette, Netflix, Oreos, Nordstrom, Macy&#39;s, Target, Walmart, MLB, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ViacomCBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS,&quot;,

 &#39;starbucks is booming today…😩&#39;,
 &quot;I&#39;d be suing for any break in sales if I owned Costa, they seem to be the only target of this reoccurring speech about people buying too many coffees. The burden must be shared! Pret, Starbucks, Nero! 🤣&quot;,
 &#39;@Starbucks @StarbucksNews I read that the blenders are jamming up the orders. Have you considered doing like the boba companies and have the sweet cheese foam pre-made, so the baristas can just pour it on top instead of having to blend up foam per order?&#39;,
 &#39;@shaiillus I love him!! I want to know about his life! This should be a whole show. What’s his love life? His parents. What kinda of world is compatible with that head? Refill stations everywhere? Lotsa tank cleaning shops instead of Starbucks? Plants and fish flakes sold here? 🤣&#39;,

I don&#39;t know where you are getting the stat, because it&#39;s not accurate. So again, the stats as a whole picture don&#39;t support your stance.&quot;,
 &#39;Starbucks said to leave a message for others. https://t.co/ZnjIsxXprt&#39;,
 &#39;The girl at Starbucks peaked her head out the drive thru window looks at the truck side to side and says “ I love your truck, it’s sooo nice” the best compliments ever, made my day \U0001faf6🏼&#39;,
 &#39;@Lintendo_64 Dunkin’ Donuts and Tim Horton’s are both far superior to Starbucks.&#39;,
 &#39;@NYC_IS_BACK @KamVTV You know when you’ve triggered a soy boy when they respond to tweets about paying $8 for anything isn’t a Starbucks coffee….&#39;,
 &#39;live laugh love starbucks&#39;,
 &#39;I have enough Starbucks points for 2 cups.&#39;,
 &quot;@StarbucksCanada, your customer service is one of the reasons why I continue to be a loyal customer. But today I&#39;m disappointed. Hubby has been a gold member for 15 years, but was denied his birthday drink today because he wasn&#39;t near a Starbucks yesterday (his actual bday) 😫&quot;,
 &#39;Walked into Starbucks with my Homer Simpson sweatshirt and a girl across from me has a simpsons sweatshirt and simpsons vans on… an angel \U0001f979😍😂&#39;,
 &#39;I don’t appreciate the Gingerbread erasure by Starbucks&#39;,
 &#39;@Starbucks no DM, Starbucks?&#39;,
 &#39;I get money bae bitch dis starbucks😉&#39;,
 &#39;i think today is the day i try the sugar cookie latte at starbucks.......&#39;,
 &#39;@AngieBeatDown @StarbucksUK I am sorry that happened to you. Please go to better places for coffee. @starbucks is hideous sloppy dishwater.&#39;,
 &#39;found my “go to “ drink at starbucks tho 🤪&#39;,
